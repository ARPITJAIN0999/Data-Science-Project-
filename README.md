Data Science has inarguably been the hottest domain of the decade, asserting its need in every single sphere of corporate life. It was not long agowhen we discovered the massive potential of incorporating ML/AI in the financial world. Now, the very idea of the two being disjointed sounds strange.

Data Science has been incremental in providing powerful insights ( which people didn't even know existed ) and helped massively increase the efficiency, helping everyone from a scalp trader to a long term debt investor. Accurate predictions, unbiased analysis, powerful tools that run through millions of rows of data in the blink of an eye have transformed the industry in ways we could've never imagined.
